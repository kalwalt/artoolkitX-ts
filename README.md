# artoolkitX-ts
**artoolkitX-ts** is the Typescript version of [ArtoolkitX.js](https:://github.com/webarkit/artoolkitXjs), the first emscripten port of [ARTollkitX](https:://github.com/artoolkitx/artoolkitx).
Most of the features are in the library, but it's in an experimental stage. Actually it can track only barcode markers but we plan to add support for pattern markers and 2d markers.

## Examples
Test the examples:
- `examples/simple_image.html` it load a simple static image and output some message in the console.
- `examples/simple_barcode.html` barcode example - a cube should appear on the barcode (partially working) -> to be fixed.
