# artoolkitX-ts
**artoolkitX-ts** is the typescript version of artoolkitX.js, the first emscripten port of [ARTollkitX](https:://github.com/artoolkitx/artoolkitx).
Most of the features are in the library, but it's in an experimental stage. Actually i can track only barcode markers but we plan to add support for pattern markers and 2d markers.

## Examples
Test the xamples in the examples folder:
- `simple_image.html` it load a simple static image and output some message in the console.
- `simple_barcode.html` barcode example - a cube should appear on the barcode (partially working) -> to be fixed.
